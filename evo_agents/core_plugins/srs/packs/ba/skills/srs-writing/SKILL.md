# Writing an SRS to its template

A document is a list of items, each with a key the hub gives and keeps. Its template (`srs-basic` unless the plugin's
config names another) says which headings and table rows are which kind of item:

| Kind | Heading or row | Code |
|---|---|---|
| section | a numbered heading (`# 2. Use Case Specifications`), Actors, Site Map, Open Items | none |
| glossary | a heading with Definitions, Glossary, Terms, Abbreviations or Acronyms | none |
| use_case | `UC <AREA>-<n>: <title>` | `UC ORD-3` |
| business_rule | `Step (2): BR <AREA><n>-<m> – <title>`, under its use case | `BR ORD3-2` |
| screen | `Screen: <title>` | `SCR-<n>`, given by the hub |
| cbr | a row of the table under Common Business Rules | `CBR 2` |
| nfr | a row of a table whose first cell is a requirement's code | `NFR-SEC-01` |

The plugin's config may replace the pattern of a kind of code; `srs__propose` answers with the pattern when a code
does not match.

## Codes

- A code is unique in the project, across documents, aliases included, and is never given again, even after its item
  was dropped.
- Never change, renumber or reuse the code of an item that has one. Rename it, move it or rewrite its body instead;
  its code stays.
- A new use case or business rule takes the next number of its area: search the area's codes with `srs__search`
  (such as `UC ORD`) and take one above the highest. A new screen takes no code: the hub gives `SCR-<n>`.
- A table row's first cell is its code: when you edit a `cbr` or an `nfr`, keep that cell as it is.

## A use case

A use case's body holds its fields as the document's other use cases do: the actor, the preconditions, the main flow
as numbered steps, the alternative flows and the postconditions. Its business rules are headings under it that name
the steps they apply to, `Step (2)` or `Steps (2, 2.1)`. Link the screens it shows with refs `uses_screen`.

## Proposing

`srs__propose` takes the document, the version you read (`base_version`), a summary, and the changes:

```json
{
  "document": "shop-srs",
  "base_version": 4,
  "summary": "UC ORD-2: retry a declined payment twice, as the member asked",
  "changes": [
    {"key": "3f9a1c07b2d4", "body": "The whole new Markdown body of the item"},
    {"key": "77c02e5a90f1", "title": "Pay for an order with a saved card"},
    {"new": {"kind": "business_rule", "title": "Retry limit", "code": "BR ORD2-3", "parent": "3f9a1c07b2d4", "steps": ["4"]}}
  ]
}
```

- A change names an item by `key` and gives what changes: `title`, the whole `body`, `steps` of a business rule, or
  the whole list of `refs`. A new item is `new`, with its kind, title, body, code, parent (key) and the sibling it
  follows (`after`, key).
- There is no change that drops an item: tell the member that a member of the project drops it.
- When the item changed since `base_version`, the hub answers a conflict with the item's text now: read it again,
  redo the change on it and propose again.
- The version goes to review at once, written as the member who asked, so another member approves it. Tell the
  member its number, what it changed and the comparison link.
